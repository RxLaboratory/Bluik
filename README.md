# Bluik
2D/Cut-Out Rigging and Animation tools for Blender

## Relocation notice!

The canonical repository for DuBlast is [on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/RxLaboratory/Bluik) but we maintain [a
mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/Bluik/tree/master) for the
time being in order to ease the transition. Please update your links
and git remotes.

The repo on github will be left around for a time as a convenience
offered to those who haven't yet created a Codeberg account. You can
still open issues here and submit pull requests. However, be sure to
branch from `master` for your pull requests instead of this branch!
